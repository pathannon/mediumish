Do you ever do things you hate?  
Of course you do. Sometimes we all do.

Life requires us to do things we hate sometimes.

I've discovered the secret to doing things I hate, without hating it.  
Here's the secret:  
<strong>When you hate <em>what</em> you have to do, find motivation in <em>why</em> you have to do it. </strong>[<a title="Tweet This" href="http://clicktotweet.com/N_i4W" target="_blank">tweet this</a>]

I hate getting up early, but I did today so my kids could enjoy a special breakfast program with their mom at school. I did not want to get up early (<em>what</em> I had to do), but I was motivated by <em>why</em> I needed to do it: to provide a good experience for my kids and wife. I love them more than I hate mornings. So I got up early today without hating it.

<strong>Discovering <em>why</em> to do something can be all the motivation you need to do the things you hate, without hating it. </strong>[<a title="Tweet This" href="http://clicktotweet.com/7Itkl" target="_blank">tweet this</a>]

You may hate the dentist, but you want to have some teeth left in 40 years. So you go to the dentist.

You may hate the gym, but you want to be healthy and have energy. So you go to the gym.

You may hate performance reviews, but you want to achieve excellence in your field. So you receive the feedback from the performance review.

<h3>An Inspiring Example</h3>
My wife hates running. She ran one 5K race a few years agoâ€”and hated it. She decided not to run any more races.

Yet, my wife loves her brother. Her brother has been a Leukemia survivor for over 10 years. This year he is the "<a title="Honored Hero Andrew Edgar" href="https://runnersweb.com/running/news_2013/rw_news_20130215_RWire_Cleveland_Marathon.html" target="_blank">honored hero</a>" for the <a title="Team in Training" href="http://www.teamintraining.org/noh/" target="_blank">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Team</a> running the Cleveland Marathon.

My wife, who hates running, is running her first 10K this weekend. She loves her brother more than she hates running. She is running in honor of her brother and to [raise money](http://pages.teamintraining.org/noh/cleve13/ahannonbah) to support Leukemia patients and research for a cure.

<strong>She found a reason to run that was stronger than her hatred of running.</strong>

I'm  proud of her. She has been training for a few months and is ready to rock the race this weekend. I think she's even enjoying it.

<strong>Sometimes, doing the things you hate just requires a bit of motivation. Find your <em>why</em>. </strong>[<a title="Tweet This" href="http://clicktotweet.com/5ysA4" target="_blank">tweet this</a>]
