Today I saw someone scurrying across the road with two umbrellas. One opened, in use, protecting her from the rain. The other in her hand. A spare carried just in case.

And I wondered: who is so worried about the rain that she carries two umbrellas?

But don’t we often do the same thing? We carry one useful “umbrella” that helps us to deal with all of the difficulties, problems, setbacks,&nbsp;annoyances&nbsp;of life. Rain comes in life and me must deal with it.

Then we carry a second “umbrella” that is simply fear that our attempts to handle life’s difficulties will fail. An attempt to be prepared for all the things&nbsp;we can’t be prepared for. We carry it because we fear the rain and don’t trust ourselves to make it through the day without getting soaked.

Holding that first useful umbrella takes one hand. A second umbrella only gets in the way, leaving you with no open hands.

<strong>What is your “second umbrella”?</strong>
For a few minutes today, try to carry just one, and see how good it is to have a free hand.

<em>“So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” -Isaiah 41:10</em>
