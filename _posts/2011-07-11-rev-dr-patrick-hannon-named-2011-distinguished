<strong>Rev. Dr. Patrick Hannon</strong>&nbsp;is a promising young alumnus serving his community, Christian higher education, and the church-at-large. Hannon received his B.A. in Christian Ministries and Music Business from Anderson University in 1996, and both this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.anderson.edu/sot/academics/mdiv/" target="_blank">M. Div.</a>&nbsp;(2000) and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.anderson.edu/sot/academics/dmin/" target="_blank">D. Min.</a>&nbsp;from Anderson University School of Theology 2011. He holds the distinction as one of fewer than 10 “Super Alumni” in Anderson College-Anderson University history to hold a bachelor’s degree and two graduate degrees all from our institution.

Hannon has already served with distinction in his short ministry career. For more than seven years, Hannon served as pastor of the Faith Community Church of God, in Grayson, Georgia, a growing community in the northern metro Atlanta area. It was there that he began honing this preaching and teaching ministry. Long time pastor (now retired), Rev. Paul Rider said of Hannon, “He is a gifted preacher. He moves with ease in the pulpit, drawing people into the message and the call to ministry that each sermon offers.” It was in this congregation that Hannon began exploring a calling to ministry in Christian higher education.

Hannon found his calling confirmed when he accepted the position as Associate Dean of the Chapel for Indiana Wesleyan University’s Wesley Chapel. In this capacity he serves as one of the campus pastors for IWU where he provides spiritual formation guidance and pastoral care to college students. Hannon also serves as an adjunct faculty member at this institution.

Hannon and his wife Alison, have three children, Eliana, Ashlyn, and Ian, who keep their lives full and enjoyable.
